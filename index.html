            <p>For centuries, electricity was thought to be the domain of sorcerers – 
                magicians who left audiences puzzled about where it came from and how it was generated. 
                And although Benjamin Franklin and his contemporaries were well aware of the phenomena when he proved the connection 
                between electricity and lightning, he had difficulty envisioning a practical use for it in 1752. In fact, 
                his most prized invention had more to do with avoiding electricity – the lightning rod. 
                All new innovations go through a similar evolution: dismissal, avoidance, fear, and perhaps finally acceptance.</p>
            <p>Almost two hundred years after Franklin’s lightning experiment, man was routinely harnessing electricity, 
                even though we still lacked a deep understanding of its origins. The Lineman’s Handbook of 1928 begins with the line: 
                “What is electricity? – No one knows.” But according to this field guide for early electrical linemen, 
                understanding the make-up of electricity wasn’t important. 
                The more significant aspect was knowing how electricity could be generated and safely used for light, heat and power.</p>
            
            <p>Today, too many people view artificial intelligence (AI) as another magical technology that’s being put to work with little 
                understanding of how it works. They view AI as special and relegated to experts who have mastered and dazzled us with it. 
                In this environment, AI has taken on an air of mysticism with promises of grandeur, and out of the reach of mere mortals.</p>

            <p>The truth, of course, is there is no magic to AI. The term Artificial Intelligence was first coined in 1956 and since then
                 the technology has progressed, disappointed, and re-emerged. As it was with electricity, the path to AI breakthroughs 
                 will come with mass experimentation. 
                While many of those experiments will fail, the successful ones will have substantial impact</p>

            <p>The truth, of course, is there is no magic to AI. The term Artificial Intelligence was first coined in 1956 and since then 
                the technology has progressed, disappointed, and re-emerged. As it was with electricity, the path to AI breakthroughs will come with mass experimentation. 
                While many of those experiments will fail, the successful ones will have substantial impact.</p>

            <p>That’s where we find ourselves today. As others, like Andrew Ng have suggested, AI is the new electricity. 
                In addition to it becoming ubiquitous and increasingly accessible, AI is enhancing and altering the way business 
                is conducted around the world. It is enabling predictions with supreme accuracy and automating business processes 
                and decision-making. The impact is vast, ranging from greater customer experiences, to intelligent products and more efficient services. 
                And in the end, the result will be economic impact for companies, countries, and society.</p>
            
            <p>To be sure, organizations that drive mass experimentation in AI will win the next decade of market opportunity.
                To breakdown and help demystify AI, one needs to consider two key elements of the category: the componentry and the process. 
                In other words, identifying what’s behind it and how it can be adopted.</p>
            <h3>The Componentry</h3>
            <p>Much like electricity was driven by basic components such as 
                resistors, capacitors, diodes, etc., AI is being driven by modern software componentry:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A unified, modern data fabric. AI feeds on data, and therefore data must be prepared for AI. 
                    A data fabric acts as a logical representation of all data assets, on any cloud. 
                    It pre-organizes and labels data across the enterprise. Seamless access 
                    to all data is available through virtualization from the firewall to the edge.</li>
                <li>A development environment and engine. A place to build, train, and run AI models. 
                    This enables end-to-end deep learning, from input to output. Machine learning models, 
                    help find patterns and structures in data that are inferred, rather than explicit. This is when it starts to feel like magic.</li>
                <li>Human features. A mechanism to bring models to life, by connecting models and applications 
                    to human features like voice, language, vision, and reasoning.</li>
                <li>AI management and exploitation. This enables you to insert AI into any application or business process, 
                    while understanding versions, how to improve impact, what has changed, bias, and variance. 
                    This is where your models live for exploitation and enables lifecycle management of all AI. 
                    Lastly, it offers proof and explain-ability for decisions made by AI.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How Data and Analytics Can Power a Transformation in Long-Term Disability</h2>
            <p>Author: Natalie Spano</p>
            <p>Date: <time datetime="2019-08-15">August 15, 2019</time></p>

            <p><img src="workers.jpeg" alt="workers image"></p>
            <p>Employer-provided disability insurance has a problem — it’s reactive, risk-based payout, and in its current state, 
                it cannot affect the metrics employers and employees truly care about: employee engagement, productivity and wellness.</p>
            
            <P>Modern disability insurance first became available in the late 19th century and was called “accident insurance.” 
                It was meant to protect workers in cases where a physical injury led to loss of productivity and gainful employment. 
                Over a century ago, employees were mostly male, and employment often came with physical demands and risks. 
                In the U.S. and other developed countries, the majority of workers 
                who enjoy such benefits are now mostly white-collar, facing different risks than their 19th-century predecessors, 
                and with vastly different goals. How can disability products be re-imagined to fit the 21st century?</P>
            <h3>Rethinking workplace risks</h3>
            <p>Except for 2012, employer-reported injuries and illnesses across all U.S. industries have decreased every year since 2004, 
                according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Manufacturing, construction and other blue-collar 
                industries saw injuries you’d expect from physically demanding jobs: muscles sprains, tears and other injuries related 
                to overexertion.</p>
            
            <p>But blue-collar workers account for only 13.9 percent of the workforce, according to the Washington Post; 15 percent of workers are in government, and the remaining 71.1 
                percent are in the service sector. The health risks that service and white-collar workers face aren’t as obvious as those blue-collar
                 workers do. Workplace stress, for instance, isn’t easy to detect, but it’s one of the top risks to white-collar workers. A 
                 Gallup poll found 94 percent of workers in the U.S. and U.K. reported high levels of work-related stress, according to HRDive. 
                 Burnout and depression also threaten productivity.</p>
            
            <p>Employers also have to contend with the consequences of opioid abuse. According to the National Business Group on Health, 
                60 percent of companies experienced at least one workplace issue because of prescription opioid drug misuse or abuse,
                 and employees battling opioid addiction commonly make mistakes, underperform and pose risks to workplace safety. 
                 A Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation study found that diminished productivity and absenteeism caused by 
                 opioid misuse cost the Massachusetts economy $2.5 billion every year.</p>
            
            <p>And employers need to start identifying that employees’ mental health affects the bottom line as much as obvious physical injuries do.</p>

            <h3>Building a continuum of health</h3>
            <p>Healthcare providers currently have no insight into worker productivity. Without a broader understanding of potential workplace risks, 
                they can’t proactively treat patients. Employers, meanwhile, want to promote wellness in the workplace,
                 but they don’t have a strong grasp on how to help employees avoid and recover from health issues.</p>
            <p>Workers are trapped in the middle. Many of them find their productivity challenged by outside factors — workplace conditions,
                 their health, personal and family factors — but they don’t have holistic support to help them manage these issues. Meanwhile, 
                 employees who have been prescribed interventions such as physical therapy, often can’t make those appointments
                  because they can’t take time off of work or struggle to pay high copays. As only point solutions are offered, each issue is 
                  compounded, contributing to greater stress and risk of productivity loss.</p>
            <p>Cognitive solutions and predictive analytics can identify upskilling opportunities to help place workers into the right positions, 
                even when they require modification of duties. This in turn helps increase employee engagement, 
                improve long-term retention and boost productivity. It also relieves the burden and cost placed on insurers, 
                human resources and managers who struggle to find the right options for employees with restrictions and limitations.</p>
            <p>How can we combat this issue? By taking a digital view of the employee health journey across the ecosystem. The only way to do this is to aggregate the data
                 and look for trends and breaks in the journey.</p>
            <p>Such a platform requires partnership and transparency across health providers, disability insurers and employers and 
                protection for employees under HIPAA and other regulations. The IBM Health platform and blockchain are a perfect fit for 
                these challenges, providing HIPAA-enabled big data platforms, trust across blockchain networks and a neutral outside party
                 to extract relevant insights and trends.</p>
